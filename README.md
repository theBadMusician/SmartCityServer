# Smart City Project

Project in course IELET1002 (Datateknikk) to create a model smart city using ESP32, Pololu Zumo 32U4 car drones and some sensors.
<br />
Although the name of this repo says "server", this is actually the code for both the frontend, which I decided to accomplish in the form of an internet website, and the backend server, which was created using Node.JS and some NPM modules specified in the 'package.json' file.

Originally project required to use Blynk cloud server and their app. I decided that it would be more fun to create my own full-stack program to achieve goals given in the project description.
